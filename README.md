# SPRING Doctoral Network Website

The official website for the SPRING (MSCA Doctoral Network) project, which focuses on resilience in future large-scale critical infrastructures.

## About SPRING

SPRING is a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) Doctoral Network under Horizon Europe that trains 15 Doctoral Candidates in the resilience design, real-time monitoring and control, anomaly detection and isolation, and incident response of geographically distributed systems of cyber-physical systems.

The project addresses critical infrastructures in domains such as energy, water, and transportation, developing methods and tools to help these systems anticipate disruptions, withstand them, adapt safely, and recover quickly.

## Website Contents

**Home** – Overview of the SPRING project, its mission, and latest news updates from the network.

**The Project** – Detailed information about SPRING's objectives and seven work packages covering allostasis-like anticipatory self-adaptability, human-interpretable diagnosis, real-time risk-aware incident response, reference scenarios and testbeds, recruitment and training, communication and dissemination, and project coordination.

**Doctoral Projects** – Information about all 15 Doctoral Candidate (DC) positions, each hosted by one of the beneficiary institutions. Projects cover topics including physics-informed adversarial robustness, formal methods for resilient-by-design systems, explainable AI, anomaly detection, distributed resilience response, digital twin architectures, and safety-critical machine learning systems.

**People** – Contact information for the coordination and management team, list of beneficiary institutions (academic and industrial partners), and associated partners that contribute use cases, secondments, testbeds, and training opportunities.

**Training & Events** – Information about SPRING training activities and network-wide events.

**Outputs** – Public outputs from the project, including scientific publications, deliverables, software, datasets, and outreach materials.

**Contact** – Contact information for general enquiries about the SPRING Doctoral Network.
