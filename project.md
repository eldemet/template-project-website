SPRING is a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) Doctoral Network under the Horizon Europe
framework. It focuses on the resilience of future large-scale critical infrastructures that are
deeply interconnected, cyber-physical, and exposed to evolving threats such as extreme weather,
cascading failures, cyber-attacks and human error.

SPRING targets large-scale systems of cyber-physical systems (SoCPS) in domains like energy,
water and transport, and aims to provide methods and tools so that these infrastructures can
anticipate disruptions, withstand them, adapt safely and recover quickly.

## Objectives

- Develop defense mechanisms that ensure allostasis-like anticipatory self-adaptability-by-design in future Critical Infrastructures.
- Develop fast and highly automatized human-interpretable diagnosis solutions for future Critical Infrastructures.
- Develop scalable techniques for real-time risk-aware incident response for future Critical Infrastructures that maintain operational system safety and performance during recovery. 
- Develop a long-lasting library of agents that provide resilience as a service to boost adoption of resilience design in future Critical Infrastructures in energy supply, water distribution, and transportation systems.
- Develop sustainable training material and promote the use of the library of agents (HTO) to ensure resilient designs in future Critical Infrastructures. 
- Bridge the gap between academic research and industrial practice in the field of Critical Infrastructures resilience.
- Experiment with and validate key enabling technologies and methods such as formal methods, explainable AI, and human-centered design, in real business scenarios and industrial infrastructures.
