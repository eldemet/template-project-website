# SPRING Doctoral Network – Example GitHub Pages Site

This is a minimal Jekyll site you can use as a starting point for
the SPRING (MSCA Doctoral Network) website.

## How to use this example

1. Create a new **public** GitHub repository under your organisation or account.
2. Download the ZIP file from ChatGPT and unzip it locally.
3. Copy all files and folders into your new repository.
4. Commit and push the files to GitHub.
5. Enable **GitHub Pages** in the repository settings (see the detailed steps in the ChatGPT message).

Once GitHub Pages is enabled, the site will be built automatically and
served at a URL like:

- `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/` (default), or
- your custom domain (e.g. `https://spring-project.eu`) if you point DNS
  records to GitHub and configure the domain in the Pages settings.

You can then edit the content in place:

- `_posts/` for news
- `project.md`, `doctoral-projects.md`, `people.md`, etc. for the main pages
- `assets/css/style.css` to adjust the look & feel
