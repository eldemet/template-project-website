This page lists the 15 SPRING Doctoral Candidate (DC) projects. Each DC focuses on a specific
aspect of resilience in large-scale critical infrastructures and is hosted by one of the
beneficiary institutions.

Below are example entries for three DCs; you can extend this pattern to DC4–DC15.

  <div class="card">
    <h3>DC1 – Physics-informed modelling for resilience</h3>
    <p class="card-meta">
      Host: Example University · Supervisors: A. Smith, B. Garcia
    </p>
    <p>
      Develop physics-informed models of interdependent infrastructures and use them to quantify
      resilience under uncertainty.
    </p>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>DC2 – Data-driven anomaly detection in cyber-physical systems</h3>
    <p class="card-meta">
      Host: Example Institute of Technology · Supervisors: C. Rossi, D. Müller
    </p>
    <p>
      Explore machine learning and statistical methods to detect failures and cyber-attacks in
      real-time from heterogeneous data streams.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>DC3 – Decision support for incident response</h3>
    <p class="card-meta">
      Host: Critical Infrastructure Operator Ltd. · Supervisors: E. Novak, F. Lee
    </p>
    <p>
      Design decision-support tools to prioritise actions and resources during disruptive events
      affecting interconnected infrastructures.

You can either keep this as a single overview page or link each DC title to a dedicated page
with further details (requirements, secondments, etc.).
