SPRING is a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) Doctoral Network under the Horizon Europe
framework. It focuses on the resilience of future large-scale critical infrastructures that are
deeply interconnected, cyber-physical, and exposed to evolving threats.

## Objectives

- Develop modelling and analysis tools to understand cascading failures and interdependencies
  in critical infrastructures.
- Design innovative monitoring, control and recovery strategies to maintain safe and reliable
  operation under disturbances and attacks.
- Train a cohort of 15 Doctoral Candidates (DCs) with interdisciplinary skills spanning
  systems & control, computer science, cyber security, and infrastructure engineering.
- Strengthen collaboration between academia, industry, and operators of critical infrastructure.

## Work Packages (illustrative example)

- **WP1 – Foundations of resilient critical infrastructures**  
  Modelling, uncertainty quantification and resilience metrics.

- **WP2 – Monitoring, detection and diagnosis**  
  Data-driven and model-based methods for anomaly and intrusion detection.

- **WP3 – Control, recovery and decision support**  
  Coordinated control and decision-making tools for resilient operation.

- **WP4 – Training, dissemination and exploitation**  
  Network-wide training events, communication, open science and exploitation of results.
