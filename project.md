SPRING is a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) Doctoral Network under the Horizon Europe
framework. It focuses on the resilience of future large-scale critical infrastructures that are
deeply interconnected, cyber-physical, and exposed to evolving threats such as extreme weather,
cascading failures, cyber-attacks and human error.

SPRING targets large-scale systems of cyber-physical systems (SoCPS) in domains like energy,
water and transport, and aims to provide methods and tools so that these infrastructures can
anticipate disruptions, withstand them, adapt safely and recover quickly.

## Objectives

- Develop modelling and analysis tools to understand cascading failures, interdependencies and
  vulnerabilities in large-scale critical infrastructures.
- Design innovative monitoring, diagnosis and incident-response strategies to maintain safe and
  reliable operation under disturbances, faults and attacks.
- Provide human-interpretable explanations and decision-support tools that help operators
  understand system behaviour and trust automated functions.
- Train a cohort of 15 Doctoral Candidates (DCs) with interdisciplinary skills spanning
  systems & control, formal methods, artificial intelligence, cyber security and infrastructure
  engineering.
- Build demonstrators and reference implementations on realistic use cases in water, energy and
  transport that showcase “resilience-by-design” approaches.
- Strengthen collaboration between academia, industry and operators of critical infrastructures,
  ensuring that research outputs can be taken up in real deployments.

## Work Packages

- **WP1 – Anticipatory self-adaptability of critical infrastructures**  
  Develop defence and adaptation mechanisms that enable future critical infrastructures to
  anticipate threats and autonomously reconfigure while preserving safety and performance.

- **WP2 – Human-interpretable diagnosis for operators**  
  Create methods for detecting, localising and explaining anomalies, failures and attacks in
  large-scale cyber-physical systems, with outputs that are understandable and trustworthy for
  human operators.

- **WP3 – Real-time and risk-aware incident response**  
  Design scalable techniques for real-time incident response in systems of cyber-physical
  systems, balancing safety, performance and resilience during and after disruptive events.

- **WP4 – Reference scenarios, testbeds and resilience library**  
  Define reference scenarios and testbeds in water, energy and transport; integrate and evaluate
  the methods developed in WP1–WP3; and build a reusable software library of resilience
  “agents”, together with guidelines and blueprints for adoption in industrial practice.
